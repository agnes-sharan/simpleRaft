** Important
-> Context
Before using any zmq library function, it is important to initialize a context
context are thread safes
an application can have more than one context

example

import zmq
context = zmq.Context()


-> Sockets

sockets are created from intialized context

example 

socket = context.socket(zmq.REP) where zmq.REP is the type of socket which has to be passed during creation



-> Messaging patterns

1) one to one
2) many to one
3) one to many

paired sockets allow the following
1) bidirectional communication
2) only one connected peer
3) no specific state in the socket
4) server listens to one port and clients connects to it
